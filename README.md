SAMPLE OUTPUT:

        Displaying a matrix:

                          Enter the number of rows: 2
                          Enter the number of columns: 3
                          Enter elements of the matrix:
                          1 2 3 4
                          5 6
                          The matrix is:
                          1 2 3 
                          4 5 6

        Addition od two matrixes: 

                         Enter number of rows for Matrix 1: 2
                         Enter number of columns for Matrix 1: 3
                         Enter number of rows for Matrix 2: 3
                         Enter number of columns for Matrix 2: 2
                         Matrix addition is not possible. Dimensions must match.


      Multiplication of matrix:
                        Enter number of rows for Matrix 1: 2
                        Enter number of columns for Matrix 1: 3
                        Enter number of rows for Matrix 2: 2
                        Enter number of columns for Matrix 2: 3
                        Matrix multiplication is not possible. Columns of Matrix 1 must equal rows of Matrix 2.

     Transpose matrix:
                        Enter number of rows of the matrix: 2
                        Enter number of columns of the matrix: 3
                        Enter elements of the matrix:
                        2 4 2 6 7 89
                        Original Matrix:
                        2 4 2 
                        6 7 89 
                        Transpose of the Matrix:
                        2 6 
                        4 7 
                        2 89 

       diagonal matrix addition:

                        Enter the number of the rows and columns: 2 3
                        Diagonal addition not possible.
