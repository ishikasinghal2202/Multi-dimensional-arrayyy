THEORY:

 2D arrays:

            A 2D array is essentially an array of arrays. It represents data in a matrix form, with rows and columns.

 Applications of 2D Arrays
 
         - Matrix operations: Addition, multiplication, transpose
         - Game boards: Chess, tic-tac-toe
         - Image processing: Pixels stored in 2D format
         - Dynamic programming: Storing intermediate results
         - Scheduling and tabular data: Time tables, spreadsheets

Multidimensional Arrays:

          Beyond 2D arrays, C++ supports multidimensional arrays like 3D arrays and higher.
         

These are useful for representing data in volumes, such as:
         
         - 3D graphics
         - Scientific simulations
         - Tensor operations

Limitations and Considerations

         - Fixed size: Arrays have a static size; use dynamic memory (e.g., pointers) for flexible structures.
         - Memory usage: Large multidimensional arrays consume significant memory.
         - Complexity: Higher dimensions increase code complexity and debugging difficulty.


SAMPLE OUTPUT:

        Displaying a matrix:

                          Enter the number of rows: 2
                          Enter the number of columns: 3
                          Enter elements of the matrix:
                          1 2 3 4
                          5 6
                          The matrix is:
                          1 2 3 
                          4 5 6

        Addition of two matrixes: 

                         Enter number of rows for Matrix 1: 2
                         Enter number of columns for Matrix 1: 3
                         Enter number of rows for Matrix 2: 3
                         Enter number of columns for Matrix 2: 2
                         Matrix addition is not possible. Dimensions must match.


      Multiplication of matrix:
                        Enter number of rows for Matrix 1: 2
                        Enter number of columns for Matrix 1: 3
                        Enter number of rows for Matrix 2: 2
                        Enter number of columns for Matrix 2: 3
                        Matrix multiplication is not possible. Columns of Matrix 1 must equal rows of Matrix 2.

     Transpose matrix:
                        Enter number of rows of the matrix: 2
                        Enter number of columns of the matrix: 3
                        Enter elements of the matrix:
                        2 4 2 6 7 89
                        Original Matrix:
                        2 4 2 
                        6 7 89 
                        Transpose of the Matrix:
                        2 6 
                        4 7 
                        2 89 

       diagonal matrix addition:

                        Enter the number of the rows and columns: 2 3
                        Diagonal addition not possible.


CONCLUSION:

           Studying 2D and multidimensional arrays in C++ equips you with tools to handle structured data efficiently. It strengthens your understanding of memory     management, indexing, and algorithmic thinkingâ€”essential for advanced programming and real-world applications
